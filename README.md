# Prism Dynamics
It plots the results generated by Desmond Simulation Suite. You can plot **Protein-RMSD, Ligand-RMSD, Protein-RMSF** & various **Ligand Properties** like **rGyr (Radius of Gyration), SASA (Solvent Accessible Surface Area), PSA (Polar surface Area)**. 

Input files are the **.dat extension files** generated by Schrodinger's Maestero Simulation Suite.

## Getting Started
* Clone the repository from github.
* Install the necessary packages (See the Prerequisites section).
* Open the terminal where you downloaded the repository & run the following command in terminal:
```
streamlit run PrismDynamics.py
```
